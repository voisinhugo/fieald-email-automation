# FIEALD email automation

This project is used by the video team of the [FIEALD](https://www.fieald.com/) association. The [FIEALD](https://www.fieald.com/) is an open stage in Paris, happening every Sunday. The artists can command videos of their performance. We were looking for a way of sending emails more easily.

It generates a static website to send emails faster. The website is available here: [https://voisinhugo.github.io/fieald-email-automation/](https://voisinhugo.github.io/fieald-email-automation/)


## Run

Just clone the project and run:
```sh
yarn
yarn start
```
You will find the app at [http://localhost:3000/fieald-email-automation](http://localhost:3000/fieald-email-automation). Enjoy!
